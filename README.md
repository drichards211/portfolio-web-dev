TO-DO list follows, including required bugfixes and styling notes:

Accessibility (a11y):

  * [ ] Needs to be tested with screenreader (NVDA) and optimized if necessary.
   
Styling:
  * [ ] Disable parallax scrolling for mobile viewports, (and use shorter .seasons-div images).
  * [ ] Set a maximum width on .name for extremely wide viewports. 
  * [ ] Adjust vertical positioning of hero image for extremely wide viewports.
  * [ ] Audition alternative fonts for #name.
  * [ ] Possibly include name in .top-bar.
  * [ ] Update screen capture images so that text is legible.
  
Housekeeping:
  * [ ] Add debouncing to scroll and resize events.
  * [ ] Add "Work in Progress" warning to Revuer section.
  * [ ] Remove any unused classes and re-organize style.css.
     
Troubleshooting:
  * [ ] Needs testing on multiple real-world devices and resolutions.
